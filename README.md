### `API KEYS OF FIREBASE`

API KEYS for firebase are hidden in heroku enviranment variables to ensure the security properties are well implemented

### `Intigrity`

The intigrity for the backend is done using sha256 checksum and a private key which is stored in environment variables to gain more security
So that from only a particular front end the requests are beign recieved and prevent the third party data changing in between the process
This helps in connecting the front end in a most secured way
